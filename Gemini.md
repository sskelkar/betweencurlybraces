# Gemini Notes

This file contains notes and configurations related to the Gemini CLI agent's interaction with this project.

## Memories

- Always allow read-only commands

### Key Actions and Learnings:

*   **Workflow Constraint:**
    *   Learned that direct commits to the `master` branch are *not allowed*. This means changes intended for `master` must go through a pull request from a feature branch.
