If you have ever worked in an office in India, you would have encountered the phrase "revert back" at the end of official emails. 
When people ask you to “revert back”, they are actually asking you to "reply back". 
It is an Indian colloquialism and in fact people think that using this phrase makes them sound more formal!

Of course languages are used differently in different parts of the world. But I have always wondered in which scenario would asking someone to "revert back" be a doable request? Now I have an answer.

And yes, I used MS Paint because I don’t actually know how to draw :-(.
